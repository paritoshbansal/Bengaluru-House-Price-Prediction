# KNN-Regression-model
# Business Problem Statement
Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengaluru, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are usually the same for all metros, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru. As a result, this projects consists of predicting the house prices in Bengaluru, India using a dataset of more than 10000 records.
